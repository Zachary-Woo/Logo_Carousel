# Logo_Carousel
Base React JS horizontal image carousel component

I have both the component jsx file (ClientList.jsx) and the ClientList.jsx components (these are inside LogoCarousel directory).

   This was based on the logo-carousel found at CodeSandbox link:https://codesandbox.io/s/logo-carousel-e6dcnw
   
   The code uploaded has been modified to fit my project using .jsx instead of .tsx
